### üß† Claude Code Integration

#### Method 1: Claude CLI with uvx (Recommended)
Use the Claude CLI to add the MCP server directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your-project

# Add the MCP server using uvx (no installation needed)
claude mcp add feature-workflow -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/aibility/feature-workflow-mcp feature-workflow-mcp --args server-start

# With environment variables
claude mcp add feature-workflow -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/aibility/feature-workflow-mcp feature-workflow-mcp \
  --args server-start \
  --env FEATURE_WORKFLOW_WORKSPACE__SYNC_IDE_SETTINGS=true \
  --env FEATURE_WORKFLOW_LINEAR__ISSUE_PREFIX=AIM

# Verify the server was added
claude mcp list
```

#### Method 2: Manual Configuration with uvx
Add to your Claude Code configuration (`.claude/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "feature-workflow": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/aibility/feature-workflow-mcp", "feature-workflow-mcp", "server-start"],
      "env": {
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_WORKSPACE__SYNC_IDE_SETTINGS": "true",
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_LINEAR__ISSUE_PREFIX": "AIM"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Method 3: Local Installation (Development)
If you've installed locally:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "feature-workflow": {
      "command": "feature-workflow-mcp",
      "args": ["server-start"],
      "env": {
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_WORKSPACE__SYNC_IDE_SETTINGS": "true",
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_LINEAR__ISSUE_PREFIX": "AIM"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Start Feature Development
In your project directory with Claude Code:

```bash
# User instruction to Claude
User: "Let's work on implementing user authentication for AIM-123"

# Claude automatically uses MCP tools
Claude: *uses start_feature MCP tool*
        "I've created a worktree for AIM-123 at: ./worktrees/aim-123-user-authentication
         
         Your IDE settings have been synced to the worktree.
         Please open this directory in a new window to continue development."
```

#### Step 3: Switch Context
```bash
# Open new terminal/Claude Code window in the worktree
cd ./worktrees/aim-123-user-authentication

# Continue development with Claude in the isolated workspace
User: "Implement the authentication middleware"
Claude: # Works normally with all project context and tooling
```

#### Step 4: Commit and Manage
```bash
User: "Commit our progress"
Claude: *uses commit_feature MCP tool*
        "Committed changes with Linear issue reference: 'Part of AIM-123'"

User: "Let's work on a different feature now"
Claude: *uses switch_feature or start_feature MCP tool*
        "Switched to feature workspace AIM-124..."
```

### üñ±Ô∏è Cursor IDE Integration

#### Step 1: Setup MCP in Cursor

Create or update the MCP configuration file at `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "feature-workflow": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/aibility/feature-workflow-mcp", "feature-workflow-mcp", "server-start"],
      "env": {
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_WORKSPACE__SYNC_IDE_SETTINGS": "true",
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_LINEAR__ISSUE_PREFIX": "AIM",
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_WORKSPACE__WORKTREES_DIR": "worktrees",
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_GIT__DEFAULT_BASE_BRANCH": "main"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative (if installed locally):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "feature-workflow": {
      "command": "feature-workflow-mcp",
      "args": ["server-start"],
      "env": {
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_WORKSPACE__SYNC_IDE_SETTINGS": "true",
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_LINEAR__ISSUE_PREFIX": "AIM",
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_WORKSPACE__WORKTREES_DIR": "worktrees",
        "FEATURE_WORKFLOW_GIT__DEFAULT_BASE_BRANCH": "main"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternative locations for the configuration file:
- **Project-specific**: `.cursor/mcp.json` (recommended for project-specific workflows)
- **Global**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (for use across all projects)

#### Step 2: Verify MCP Server
After creating the configuration:

1. **Restart Cursor** to load the new MCP server
2. **Open the project** where you added the configuration
3. **Check Cursor's output panel** for MCP server logs
4. **Test the integration** by asking Cursor to list features or start a new feature

#### Step 3: Natural Language Workflow
```bash
# In your main project with Cursor AI
User: "Create a new feature workspace for implementing payment processing (AIM-124)"

# Cursor uses MCP server
Cursor AI: "I've created a worktree at ./worktrees/aim-124-payment-processing
           Opening the workspace now..."

# Cursor automatically opens new window with the worktree
# All extensions, settings, and AI context work normally
```

#### Step 4: Parallel Development
```bash
# Multiple Cursor windows can work on different features simultaneously
Window 1: ./worktrees/aim-123-auth (Authentication feature)
Window 2: ./worktrees/aim-124-payments (Payment feature)  
Window 3: ./ (Main project for reviews/coordination)

# Each workspace has:
‚úÖ Full project files and history
‚úÖ Synced .cursor/ AI context
‚úÖ Synced .vscode/ settings
‚úÖ Independent git branches
‚úÖ No merge conflicts between features
```

### üîÑ Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start new feature (in main project)
User: "Let's implement user permissions for AIM-125"
AI: *creates worktree with synced settings*

# 2. Open worktree in new IDE window
# File: ./worktrees/aim-125-user-permissions/
# - All IDE features work normally
# - Full project context available
# - Git branch: feature/aim-125-user-permissions

# 3. Develop feature with AI assistance
User: "Add role-based permission middleware"
AI: *implements feature with full context*

# 4. Commit progress
User: "Commit this implementation"
AI: *uses commit_feature MCP tool*
    "Committed: 'Add role-based permission middleware - Part of AIM-125'"

# 5. Sync with latest changes
User: "Sync with main branch"
AI: *uses sync_feature MCP tool*
    "Synced worktree with main - no conflicts detected"

# 6. Complete feature
User: "This feature is done, create PR"
AI: *uses finish_feature MCP tool*
    "Created PR #42 and cleaned up worktree"

# 7. Switch to next feature
User: "Now let's work on AIM-126 dashboard improvements"
AI: *starts new worktree for next feature*
```

### üéØ Pro Tips for AI-Assisted Development

#### Best Practices:
1. **Start each feature conversation** by mentioning the Linear issue ID
2. **Let the AI manage worktrees** - it knows when to create, switch, and sync
3. **Use descriptive feature names** for better workspace organization
4. **Open worktrees in separate IDE windows** for parallel development
5. **Commit frequently** with AI assistance for proper Linear integration

#### Command Examples:
```bash
# Natural language commands that trigger MCP tools:
"Start working on AIM-123 user authentication"      ‚Üí start_feature
"Show me all active features"                       ‚Üí list_features  
"Switch to the payment processing feature"          ‚Üí switch_feature
"Commit our authentication changes"                 ‚Üí commit_feature
"Sync this feature with the latest main branch"     ‚Üí sync_feature
"We're done with this feature, create a PR"         ‚Üí finish_feature
"Clean up old completed features"                   ‚Üí cleanup_features
```

#### IDE Settings Synced Automatically:
- **VS Code**: `.vscode/settings.json`, extensions, workspace config
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/` AI context, custom prompts, preferences  
- **IntelliJ/PyCharm**: `.idea/` project settings, code styles
- **Custom configs**: Add to `FEATURE_WORKFLOW_WORKSPACE__IDE_CONFIG_DIRS`

### üîß Troubleshooting MCP Setup

#### Common Issues:

**1. "MCP server not found" error:**
```bash
# Ensure the package is installed
pip install -e .

# Verify the command is available
which feature-workflow-mcp

# Check if virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

**2. "Permission denied" errors:**
```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x $(which feature-workflow-mcp)
```

**3. Cursor not loading MCP configuration:**
- Restart Cursor completely after adding `.cursor/mcp.json`
- Check the configuration file syntax with a JSON validator
- Verify the file is in the correct location (project root or `~/.cursor/`)
- Check Cursor's output panel for error messages

**4. Claude CLI issues:**
```bash
# Update Claude CLI to latest version
claude --version

# Re-add the MCP server if needed
claude mcp remove feature-workflow
claude mcp add feature-workflow feature-workflow-mcp --args server-start
```

**5. Environment variables not loading:**
- Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
- Ensure environment variables are properly set
- Restart the IDE after changing environment configuration

## Linear Integration

This server integrates with Linear through simple commit message conventions:

- **`Part of AIM-123`** - Links commit to Linear issue AIM-123
- **`Fixes AIM-123`** - Links commit and closes Linear issue AIM-123
